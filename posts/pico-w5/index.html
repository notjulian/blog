<meta name=description content="Let&rsquo;s review and play with the Elecrow Pico W5.
The Elecrow Pico W5 is a microcontroller development board based on the RP2040 chip (the same chip used in Raspberry Pi Pico) with enhanced wireless capabilities. Key features include:

RP2040 microcontroller with dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor
Support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi using the BW16 module from AiThinker
Bluetooth 5 connectivity
USB-C connector for power and programming
Compatible with MicroPython, C/C++, and other programming languages

Pros

The dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) is a significant upgrade over the standard Raspberry Pi Pico W, which only supports 2.4GHz
RP2040 is a proven microcontroller with good community support
USB-C connection is more modern than micro-USB found on some other boards

Cons

As a third-party board, it may have less community support than official Raspberry Pi products

Setting Up MicroPython on Elecrow Pico W5
